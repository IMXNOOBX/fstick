This is a simple project to play around with the [M5StickC Plus](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit) trying to mimic a flipper zero functionality. This project is based on [nemo](https://github.com/n0xa/m5stick-nemo), but it also has many features from other projects credited below. Even though the project is published, it is still a work in progress, and I will continue working on it for a while. Feel free to contribute without changing the topic of the project.
