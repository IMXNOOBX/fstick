This is a simple project to play around with the [M5StickC Plus](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit) trying to mimic a flipper zero functionality. I bought it cause i couldn't afford the flipper zero myself :c. This project is based on many different projects credited below. Even though the project is published, it is still a work in progress, and I will continue working on it for a while. Feel free to contribute and share your incredible ideas.
