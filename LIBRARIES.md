You can install the libraries using the Arduino Library Manager. Open the Arduino IDE and go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`, then search for the library name and install it.

*For more information you can read [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) which has the commands to install them with arduino-cli*
